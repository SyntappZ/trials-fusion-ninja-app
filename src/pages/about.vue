    <f7-block strong>
      <p>I made this app to make it easier to search for ninjas on android as the fusion ninja central website does not work to well on mobile screens.</p>
      <p>That being said they made a great site and put a lot of time in building the site and gathering all the track data which this app uses, so all credit goes to them...</p>

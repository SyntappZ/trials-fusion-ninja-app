# trial fusion ninja app
 android app

## making this project

i made this app for a game called trials fusion, it allows people to search for other peoples ninja tracks so they can play them, there is already a website that does this called https://fusion.ninja-central.com but its not very responsive on mobile and makes it hard to use,
all information for the app comes from the website i used a web scrapper with node.js to get the track details and converted into an object this app was made using vue, framework7 and cordova it was fun making this app as i am a fan of the game it helped me understand how to use vue, framework7 and cordova together and i also learned about virtual lists making this app.
